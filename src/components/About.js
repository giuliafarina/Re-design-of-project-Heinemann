    return <p>Reinhard W. Heinemann was born in 1895 and was primarily inspired creatively by the 1900s and 1910s growing up. The first decades of the twentieth century were defined by the vibrant development of visual and pictorial art. These decades were an time of experimentation, with artists delving into ideas surrounding Post-Impressionism, Expressionism and Abstraction. These developments inspired artist communities and collectives around the world, with many groups exploring different methods of expressing their ideas. Across the world, Expressive painting continued to be explored and developed in many countries. In France in the early 1900s, the Nabis delved into this movement, and were soon followed by German groups such as Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter. Through this movement the careers of some renowned artists such as Kirchner, Franz Marc, and Wassily Kandinsky were developed.</p>;
